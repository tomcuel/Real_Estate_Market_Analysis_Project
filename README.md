# Real Estate Market Analysis Project 
> In the context of a statistic lesson on times series, this project analyzes the real estate market in Ille-et-Vilaine, France. Using historical transaction data, we aim to identify key factors influencing house prices and develop simple predictive models to estimate future prices.

The analysis includes:
* Data preprocessing (outlier removal, missing value treatment, normalization).
* Exploratory data analysis (distribution, trends, seasonality).
* Statistical modeling (Gaussian kernel smoothing, polynomial regression, moving averages).
* Time series forecasting (exponential smoothing, validation, and prediction).
The dataset can be found on the Kaggle website via this (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cheneblanc/housing-prices-35-fr) or by searching by its name : Housing prices France 35
it isn't in the repositery for size constraints matter because of GitHub
